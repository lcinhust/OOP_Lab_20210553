1. Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. 
Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
When adding a method to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for DVD, using varargs syntax has advantages such as convenience 
and flexibility, but also has disadvantages such as potential performance and memory usage issues. The choice between using 
varargs syntax or passing an array parameter depends on the specific requirements of the application.

2. Is java a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference Programming language
Java is a pass-by-value programming language, meaning that when a method is called, copies of the argument values are passed 
to the method, not references to the original objects.

3. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
The swap method only swaps the contents of the objects referred to by copies of the original references passed as arguments, 
the original objects themselves. Therefore, the original references and their titles remain unchanged after the method call.

4. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
The changeTitle method changes the title attribute of the DigitalVideoDisc object referred to by jungleDVD by directly 
accessing the actual attribute, not a copy of it. The new title passed as an argument is used to change the value of the 
title attribute, resulting in the title of jungleDVD being changed.
